# GitHub repo streak checker

App fetches GitHub repository info via GitHub API and checks value of 'pushed_at'. It compares this date with today's date with granularity to day and based on this comparsion decides if repo has any pushes on current day.

If repo has pushes app displays fire symbol and if it doesn't have any pushes it tells you to go and code.

I'm also going to create widget for this app.

I've created this app because of 100 Days Of SwiftUI, to remind me about coding every day.
