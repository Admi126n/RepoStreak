# RepoStreak

With this app you can track commits streak on your public GitHub repositories. All you need to do is provide your username and choose main repository.

## Main screen

Here at the middle of the screen you can see your main reporitory streak and at the bottom all other repositories.

##

I've created this app because of 100 Days Of SwiftUI, to remind me about coding every day.

I'd like to add notifications which will notify user every evening if main repository streak isn't extended and maybe also lock screen widget.
